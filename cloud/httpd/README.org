* Mutli Processes

    SO_REUSEPORT allows completely duplicate bindings by multiple
    processes if they all set SO_REUSEPORT before binding the port.
    This option permits multiple instances of a program to each
    receive UDP/IP multicast or broadcast datagrams destined for the
    bound port.
