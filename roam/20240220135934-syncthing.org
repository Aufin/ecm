#+title: Syncthing

[[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] is a continuous file synchronization program. It
synchronizes files between two or more computers in real time, safely
protected from prying eyes.

We are using it a lot! Most things are owned by the [[id:d881ec96-8f43-4c62-a3f3-21f16dd7bcc6][ecm unix user.]]

We want to ensure it can be read from the LAN, not just the locahost

#+begin_src bash
  echo '[Service]' > /tmp/ecm_sync.conf
  echo ExecStart= >> /tmp/ecm_sync.conf
  echo ExecStart=/usr/bin/syncthing serve --no-browser --gui-address 0.0.0.0:8384 --no-restart --logflags=0  >> /tmp/ecm_sync.conf
  sh -c 'SYSTEMD_EDITOR="cp /tmp/ecm_sync.conf" systemctl edit syncthing@ecm.service'
#+end_src


Or the alternative
#+begin_src
  sudo systemctl edit --full syncthing@ecm.service
#+end_src

That gives us this.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to install Syncthing on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. For those of you who didn't know, Syncthing is an open-source continuous file synchronization used to sync files between two or more computers in a network. Syncthing does not upload your data to the cloud but exchanges your data across your machines as soon as they are online at the same time. It supports cross-platform and is available on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and much more it is possible to sync multiple devices.

This article assumes you have at least basic knowledge of Linux, know how to use the shell, and most importantly, you host your site on your own VPS. The installation is quite simple and assumes you are running in the root account, if not you may need to add ‘ =sudo=‘ to the commands to get root privileges. I will show you the step-by-step installation of the Syncthing on Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish). You can follow the same instructions for Ubuntu 22.04 and any other Debian-based distribution like Linux Mint, Elementary OS, Pop!_OS, and more as well.

__

*Prerequisites*

- A server running one of the following operating systems: Ubuntu 22.04, 20.04, and any other Debian-based distribution like Linux Mint.
- It's recommended that you use a fresh OS install to prevent any potential issues.
- SSH access to the server (or just open Terminal if you're on a desktop).
- A =non-root sudo user= or access to the =  root user=. We recommend acting as a =  non-root sudo user=, however, as you can harm your system if you're not careful when acting as the root.

** Install Syncthing on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish

*** Step 1. First, make sure that all your system packages are up-to-date by running the following =apt= commands in the terminal.

#+begin_src sh
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade
  sudo apt install software-properties-common apt-transport-https wget ca-certificates gnupg2 ubuntu-keyring
#+end_src

*** Step 2. Installing Syncthing on Ubuntu 22.04.

By default, the Syncthing is not available on Ubuntu 22.04 base repository. Now run the following command below to add the Syncthing repository to your Ubuntu system:

#+begin_src sh
  echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/syncthing-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.syncthing.net/ syncthing stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/syncthing.list
#+end_src

Next, import the GPG key:

#+begin_src sh
  sudo curl -s -o /usr/share/keyrings/syncthing-archive-keyring.gpg https://syncthing.net/release-key.gpg
#+end_src

After the repository is enabled, now install the latest version of Syncthing using the below command:

#+begin_src sh
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install syncthing
#+end_src

Confirm the installation and check the installed build version of Syncthing:

#+begin_src sh
  syncthing --version
#+end_src

** Step 3. Enable the Syncthing service.

Syncthing is now installed but we need to enable it manually using the
=systemctl= command to automatically start it at bootup. The official
Syncthing package ships with the needed =systemd= service file under
=/lib/systemd/system/syncthing@.service=:

#+begin_src sh
  sudo systemctl enable syncthing@ecm.service
  sudo systemctl start syncthing@ecm.service
  # Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/syncthing@ecm.service → /lib/systemd/system/syncthing@.service.
  systemctl status syncthing@ecm.service
#+end_src

** Step 4. Configure Firewall.

Ubuntu 22.04 has =ufw= a firewall running by default.

We don't want that for our local servers as they are not in the DMZ

#+begin_src sh
  sudo ufw disable sudo ufw status
#+end_src


Now we enable
connection through ports =22000=:

#+begin_src sh
  sudo ufw allow 22000/tcp
  sudo ufw enable
  sudo ufw status
#+end_src

** Step 5. Accessing Syncthing Web Interface.

Once completely successful installed, now open your web browser and
access the Syncthing web UI using the URL
=http://your-ip-address:8384=. You will be taken to the Syncthing
dashboard as shown below:

Step 6. Installing Syncthing on other OS.

Go to the [[https://syncthing.net/downloads/][Syncthing download page]] and install Syncthing on other operating systems like Windows, macOS, BSD, and Android. Currently, there is no official client for iOS. You can use the third-party app [[https://www.mobiussync.com/][MobiusSync]].

Congratulations! You have successfully [[https://idroot.us/install-syncthing-ubuntu-20-04/][installed Syncthing]]. Thanks for using this tutorial for installing the Syncthing on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish system.
