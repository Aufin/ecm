#+TITLE: Documentation

Though ECM is mostly literate there's still a need for docs that do
not quite fit within the source tree catagories

The most relevant one is [[file:xlsx-reporting-standards-lloyds-claims-template-V52.xlsx][Lloyd's Claim Reporting Template]] and the [[file:pdf-reporting-standards-lloyds-coverholder-reporting-standards-user-guide-V52.pdf][PDF
describing it]].
