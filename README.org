#+TITLE: Electronic Claims Manager : Monorepo

ECM is a platform primarily for Adjusters, Examiners, and other
Insurance Claim & Risk Management Services.

It's composed of many parts, some of which are indepenently
useful. Monorepo time!

* Org Roam

I'm trying to get everything together for easy access!

Right now I'm *supposed* to put most things in a local [[file:roam/README.org][Org Roam]] and go
from there.

Org-roam is the slip-box, digitalized in Org-mode. Every zettel (card)
is a plain-text, Org-mode file. In the same way one would maintain a
paper slip-box, Org-roam makes it easy to create new zettels,
pre-filling boilerplate content using a powerful templating system.

The comments in the [[file:.dir-locals.el::((nil . ((eval . (setq-local][.dir-locals.el]] should cover more.
